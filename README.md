# NetflixSystem

# Getting Started
Copy the Netflix data into the netflix folder (I was unable to upload it to elearn due to the size restriction.)

Head to the following link and download the command line tools for your system.
https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd

Once this is downloaded, navigate the command prompt or terminal to this directory and run the following commands:
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run

once ran it will go through the program execution as per normal.
